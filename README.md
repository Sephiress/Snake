# Snake
Simple game "Snake" with menu.
Ok so recently I was working with my new console project with C#.
I added some options in menu like save a score, delete score, easy tutorial (idk why I add this, for fun) and ofc game.

I realise that game have a one issue - when Meal resp in coordinate where snake's body is, this meal abandon and next meal didnt appear. 
But idk, I only had one time this problem, just too random.
